## Inspiration

### Action

- “We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action.” — [_Frank Tibolt_](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2085007.Frank_Tibolt)
- “If you really want to learn and get better at anything, have any chance of becoming an expert, you have to be willing to be uncomfortable. Because thinking takes effort. It involves fighting through confusion.” — [_Derek Muller_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM&t=694s)
- “Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; its when you had everything to do, and you've done it.” — [_Margaret Thatcher_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher)
- “As I grow older, I pay less attention to what people say. I just watch what they do.” — [_Andrew Carnegie_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie)
- “If you do the work, you work hard enough, dreams come true. You know that, we all know that. But hopefully what you get from tonight is that those times when you get up early and you work hard; those times when you stay up late and you work hard; those times when don’t feel like working — you’re too tired, you don’t want to push yourself — but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That’s the dream.” — [_Kobe Byrant_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2Qpl1Q3OkA&t=4m50s)
- “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” — [_Theodore Roosevelt_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic)
- “Action expresses priorities.” — [_Gandhi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Gandhi)
- “If you want to get things done, you positively have to understand at any given point in time what is the most important thing to get done right now and if you're not doing it, you're not making progress at the fastest possible rate.” — [_Joel Spolsky_](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)

### Mentality

- “Your future depends on many things, but mostly on you.” — [_Frank Tyger_](https://www.franktyger.info/frank-tyger-in-his-own-words.htm)
- “The world of achievement has always belonged to the optimist.” — _J. Harold Wilkins_
- “Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.” — [_Steve Jobs_](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=steve+jobs+commencement+speech)
- “Life isn't about waiting for the storm clouds to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.” — _Unknown_
- “Have a healthy disregard for the impossible.” — [_LeaderShape_](http://www.leadershape.org/institute)
- “The greater the artist, the greater the doubt. Perfect confidence is granted to the less talented as a consolation prize.” — [_Robert Hughes_](http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,984678,00.html)
- “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.” — [_Steve Jobs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs)
- “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.” — [_Whole Earth Catalog_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog)
