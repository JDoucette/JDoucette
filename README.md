## Inspiration

### Action

- “We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action.” — [_Frank Tibolt_](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2085007.Frank_Tibolt)
- “If you really want to learn and get better at anything, have any chance of becoming an expert, you have to be willing to be uncomfortable. Because thinking takes effort. It involves fighting through confusion.” — [_Derek Muller_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM&t=694s)
- “Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; its when you had everything to do, and you've done it.” — [_Margaret Thatcher_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher)
- “As I grow older, I pay less attention to what people say. I just watch what they do.” — [_Andrew Carnegie_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie)
- “If you do the work, you work hard enough, dreams come true. You know that, we all know that. But hopefully what you get from tonight is that those times when you get up early and you work hard; those times when you stay up late and you work hard; those times when don’t feel like working — you’re too tired, you don’t want to push yourself — but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That’s the dream.” — [_Kobe Byrant_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2Qpl1Q3OkA&t=4m50s)
- “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” — [_Theodore Roosevelt_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic)
- “Action expresses priorities.” — [_Gandhi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Gandhi)
- “If you want to get things done, you positively have to understand at any given point in time what is the most important thing to get done right now and if you're not doing it, you're not making progress at the fastest possible rate.” — [_Joel Spolsky_](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)

### Mentality

- “Your future depends on many things, but mostly on you.” — [_Frank Tyger_](https://www.franktyger.info/frank-tyger-in-his-own-words.htm)
- “The world of achievement has always belonged to the optimist.” — _J. Harold Wilkins_
- “Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.” — [_Steve Jobs_](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=steve+jobs+commencement+speech)
- “Life isn't about waiting for the storm clouds to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.” — _Unknown_
- “Have a healthy disregard for the impossible.” — [_LeaderShape_](http://www.leadershape.org/institute)
- “The greater the artist, the greater the doubt. Perfect confidence is granted to the less talented as a consolation prize.” — [_Robert Hughes_](http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,984678,00.html)
- “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.” — [_Steve Jobs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs)
- “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.” — [_Whole Earth Catalog_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog)

## Who I'd Like To Meet

> _**Jason's note:** This was written for the "Who I'd Like To Meet" section of my MySpace profile years ago after a particularly troubled time surrounded by misunderstanding. I saw the heading "Who I'd Like To Meet" and considered who I wanted around myself.  I then wrote the below in about 5 minutes.  I've re-read it dozens of times and I have not changed a word._

_**People who are passionate, motivated, and positive thinking.**_ People with goals, who believe their future depends on their decisions, actions, and inactions. People who have dreams and are willing to sacrifice to chase them. People who are real, who are comfortable being themselves, who need not live through other people. People who don't conform, and who reject the superficial society we live in. People who believe _**you can never truly be happy without following your passions.**_ People who are not judgmental towards other people's passions merely because they don't relate to them. People who can respect someone for following their passions regardless if it doesn't make them popular, or let them fit in to a preconceived notion of how people should be. People who believe that knowledge is useless without intelligence to apply it. People who believe that the knowledge, intelligence, and understanding gained is more important than the test mark which is supposed to represent them. People who believe _**we live in a world of probability, not chaos**_, and that we have a large impact on the outcome. People who believe success has little to do with luck or natural talent, and almost everything to do with work ethic, and this is where true genius lies. People who choose to see opportunity because they look for it. People who believe that life is short, and want to make the most out of it. _**People who are never bored.**_ People who do not believe that the world owes them a favour. People who _**accept responsibility of self**_. People who believe the fact that we have free will may mean _**we already live in the 'heaven' that so many of us hope exists**_ in an afterlife. People who find it refreshing that you get out what you put in, and wouldn't want it any other way. People who are not just willing to find faults, but who will make effort to understand the reasons behind them, who can appreciate their existence, and who can place efforts to correct them. People who can _**respect other people's worlds**_. People who are open minded. People who can play devil's advocate on their own thoughts. People who are humble, who realize how fallible our memory is, as well as our logical reasoning powers. People who don't resort to memory to find 'truths' because it is always faulty. People who realize that we remember only our perception of the past, and not its particulars; that we never remember exact words, but only our understanding of them. _**People willing to admit they could be wrong.**_ People who realize just how little we all know, who understand that the notion anyone could completely understand any subject, without ever needing to consider new information, is ludicrous. People who understand _**freedom is of ultimate importance**_, as it allows people to pursue their goals, and be themselves. People who do not expect obligation, a form of control, especially from favours. People who do not attempt favours without first looking for understanding. _**People who are searching for the truth**_, and thus wish to know and deal with reality. People who don't believe their view of the world is the only way it should be viewed. People willing to listen more than they speak. Not people who are insecure that they may be wrong, thus creating their own perception of reality to satisfy their opinions, to protect their ego. In other words, people who _**look at the facts first, and then form opinions**_, rather than form opinions first, and create facts to support their views. People who allow their ideas to be challenged, with the notion their thoughts may be wrong, and are willing to accept change. People who understand that _**time is a person's most cherished possession**_, and when you take it away, you are taking away the potential of that person, and thus a part of them.
